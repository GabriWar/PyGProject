## Playing Tales of Sophie
To play this game, you will need clone that repo and install requirements.txt. Then, just run main.py.

## Motivation and Intent
> Tales of Sophie is a game made by a group of homies. The ideia just apperared randomly and here we are;

>The game objective is deliver a brand new rpg and storytelling experience. Also, the mechanics should be complex to improve ourself as developers.

## Design Goals(#design-goals)
Make a game in pygame is REALLY DIFFICULT. Almost a death clause, for real.

So, to turn off the difficults we split the game objectives in three;
* [x] Storytelling - The GAME NEED TO BE A GOOD EXPERIENCE. So the story is the principal factor
* [x] Gameplay - Gameplay is the reason to why play this game. Fun mechanics and sensations is the principal factor
* [x] Feelings - Nice music and nice Sprites, we want to provide the best audiovisual experience ever.

## ToS Philosophies
These following philosophies are the central flux of the game>

* **Emotions** - A constant flux of emotions, such as fear, hapiness and others should be present in the entire player traject. We will provide time. Time to rest, time to explore and far more.
* **Accessible** - Game tutorials and infos should be avaible all the time and near the player. Also, mostly anyone can play this game... easy controls and multiple controls types will be present.
* **Customisable** - The player will play the game as the way he want to. We don't set a main path or story flux. Make you own history in ToS. Sophie is just a way to push you into the game.
